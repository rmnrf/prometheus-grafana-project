## Kanban Application

This is a simple implementation of a Kanban Board, a tool that helps visualize and manage work. Originally it was first created in Toyota automotive, but nowadays it's widely used in software development.

A Kanban Board is usually made of 3 columns - *TODO*, *InProgres*s & *Done*. In each column there are Post-it notes that represents task and their status.

As already stated this project is an implementation of such board and made of 3 separate Docker containers that holds:

- PostgreSQL database
